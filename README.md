## **🛠 How to Set Up EazyShip Rwanda (Step-by-Step Guide)**  

### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**  
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:  

✅ **Node.js (v18+)** → [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
✅ **npm or yarn** → Comes with Node.js  
✅ **PostgreSQL** → [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)  
✅ **Git** → [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)  

### **2️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
Open your **terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, or Terminal on macOS/Linux)** and run:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denismitali17/eazyship-rwanda.git
```

Now, navigate into the project folder:  

```bash
cd eazyship-rwanda/frontend
```

---

### **3️⃣ Install Project Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install all required packages:  

```bash
npm install
```

If you're using **yarn**, use:  

```bash
yarn install
```

---

### **4️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables**  
EazyShip uses **environment variables** to store **database credentials** and **authentication secrets**.  

1. **Create an `.env` file** in the `frontend/` directory:  
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. **Edit the `.env` file** and update the values:  

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

📌 **Where do I get these values?**  
- `DATABASE_URL`: If using PostgreSQL locally, it might look like this:  
  ```
  postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/eazyship
  ```
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Generate a secret with this command:  
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: If running locally, set it to:  
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```

---

### **5️⃣ Set Up the Database**  
Since EazyShip uses **PostgreSQL**, you need to create the database and apply migrations.  

1. **Make sure PostgreSQL is running** on your system.  
2. Run the following command to create the database tables:  

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

💡 This will apply all **database schema changes** and create the necessary tables.  

To view your database structure, you can also run:  

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

---

### **6️⃣ Start the Development Server**  
Run the following command to **start the server**:  

```bash
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project will be **live on:**  

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### **7️⃣ Testing the Setup**  
To ensure everything is working correctly:  

- **Sign up** as a new user  
- **Log in** and track shipments  
- **Visit the Admin Dashboard** (only if you have an admin account)  

If everything works, **you're good to go!** 🎉
